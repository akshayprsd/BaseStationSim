# BaseStationSim
Synopsis This application was made to simulate the operation of a 3 sectored base station along a road. The program simulates the cellular traffic on a 6km stretch of a road where cars are moving. Critical KPIs such as Handoffs, Call Drops, Call Blocks, Successfull calls, etc. are reported.

Motivation This was done to gain a better understand of cellular tower operations.

Installation Please use main.py to run the simulation.

Work is under progress. We intend on adding a GUI to help change parameters and increase the usability of the program
